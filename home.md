## Values

#### Community

Promoting empathy for everyone in our community is at the heart of our mission. We strive to foster a strong sense of belonging by building alongside people, not just for them. Inclusivity is one of our principles, ensuring that everything we create is accessible and beneficial to all. Our ultimate goal is to spread kindness and unite people, making our world a better place for everyone.

#### Empowerment

Our philosophy revolves around the values of unwavering patience and support. We are dedicated to lifting individuals up, igniting a sense of purpose in their lives, and empowering them to pursue their causes enthusiastically. Our leadership inspires people to embrace boldness, passion, and pride as they strive to make a meaningful impact in their journeys.

#### Honesty

Our commitment to transparency and truthfulness forms the bedrock of our approach. We never shy away from inconvenient facts, ensuring our insights are always grounded in reality and never manipulated to suit a particular narrative. Building trust is our utmost priority, and it starts with being forthright and honest in all aspects of our work.

#### Adaptability

Embracing positive change is core to our missions, as we constantly strive for progress. We firmly reject the notion of taking action solely to maintain the status quo, believing that we must be the catalyst for the changes we envision in the world. With unwavering determination, we are committed to moving steadily towards a more sustainable future.

## Principles

1. **(Our guiding principle) The value of a company is not only measured by the profit it makes, but also by the positive impact on people's lives and leaving the planet in a better place than they found it.**
2. **All we ever really do is tell empathetic stories about people.** Everything we do starts and ends with people endeavouring to improve their lives.
3. **Community Counts.** As we are greater than the sum of our parts, bringing people together under a shared purpose is recognised as a path of doing.
4. **Everything is an experiment.** 
5. **Anything + Time = Change.** It's our one true inevitability, and so we seek to empower and include people in the transitions everyone experiences. This is to bring in innovation, creativity, and revolution. 
6. **Success is a result of iteration.** All good things are a work in progress, forever. We build successful products starting from 
7. **Success is finding a simple solution to a complex problem without simplifying the problem first.** We reject any oversimplification or solutionism. We recognise that problems are complex, multi-faceted, historic, nuanced, broad, and ultimately experienced by a person.
8. **Urgency is the enemy of the important.** Forcing a sense of urgency when it is not necessary not only creates a difficult environment for people to work in but puts aside the right thing to do for the quick.
9. **Process is the enemy of creativity.** Working in teams, large or small can breed process and systems, but as time goes on, it's easy to find leftover process that takes with little benefit. The ultimate goal of a process is to make itself redundant.
10. **No argument is greater than the one of inclusion.**
11. **Strategy > Tactics.**
12. **Legitimacy is needed in both the concept and the details.** Working on an idea or problem needs validation from the top and bottom levels together to be truthful in your assessment. 
13. **Life first, business after, always asynchronous.** No loyalty is expected at Chuffed. Everybody's life and well-being are a priority over any operation.
14. **Don't bump good decisions for managing bad decisions.** Moving forward is how Chuffed approaches all situations, and dealing with something that no longer serves it's purpose or trying to implement beyond the capabilities of a solution will default to do something new.
