## Principles

1. **(Our guiding principle) The value of a company is not only measured by the profit it makes, but also in the positive impact on people's lives and leaving the planet in a better place than they found it.**
2. **All we ever really do is tell empathetic stories about people.** Everything we do starts and ends with people endeavouring to improve people's lives.
3. **Community Counts.** As we are greater than the sum of our parts, bringing people together under a shared purpose is recognised as a path of doing.
4. **Everything is an experiment.** 
5. **Anything + Time = Change.** It's our one true inevitability, and so we seek to empower and include people in the transitions everyone experiences. This is to bring in innovation, creativity, and revolution. 
6. **Success is a result of iteration.** 
7. **Success is finding a simple solution to a complex problem without simplifying the problem first.** We reject any oversimplification or solutionism, we recognise that problems are complex, multi-faceted,  
8. Urgency is the enemy of the important.
9. Process is the enemy of creativity.
10. No argument is greater than the one of inclusion.
11. Strategy > Tactics.
12. Legitimacy is needed in both the concept and the details.
13. Life first, business after, always asynchronous.
14. Don't bump good decisions for managing bad decisions.
