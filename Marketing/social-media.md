# Social Media and Content Marketing Strategy

The purpose of this document is to lay out how I envisage the digital marketing strategy for Chuffed over the next 3-6 months. This is a live document that will change over time as we learn various techniques and optimise our approach.
## Purpose

For Chuffed to communicate the knowledge of product development and a brand that is an authority on a subject.
## Vision

Chuffed will create engaging content that will deliver value to help people go from idea to app through a collection of resources and ideas to get people to success.
## Goals

- Chuffed needs a clear brand voice people can know, trust, and like.
- Chuffed needs a repository of content that people can share and refer to.
- Chuffed wants to grow a community of people who want to build apps and grow their success.
# Implementation

Below is a list of the content types that Chuffed feels are appropriate/useful.

This has been formatted in a table and assessed for effort and value, that is, how much will we have to do and what do people and ourselves get out of it.

## Actions

Chuffed will use the low- and medium-effort content to validate the high-effort content. For example, create several LinkedIn text posts. If one has good engagement, then that can be expanded to a LinkedIn document, and if that has great engagement, then make a LinkedIn video.

Therefore, every batch of content will be focused around one subject, e.g. how to build an MVP way user interviews are important, and will go through a 3-week sprint that will move through a stage every week.
#### Subject Sprint

|Stage 1: Research|Stage 2: Short-form content|Stage 3: Long-form content|Stage 4: Evaluation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|
|Look into interesting stats, how is big in the space, and who is new. Use this to ideate on content.|Create a high number of low-effort content that is broad in subject and merely information.|Use successful content from Stage 1 to plan and produce high-effort/high-value content.|Look at all content and discuss what went well and if the subject is worth doing again.|
