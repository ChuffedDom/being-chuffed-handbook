# Meetings

This page describes the format and setup for every meeting Chuffed will hold.

Chuffed sees meetings as only a tool for discussion, ideation, and pitching ideas. Meetings are not a place for decisions to be made. Don't do physical meetings in a digital space. 

- Chuffed wants all meetings to have an agenda so everyone who attends can prepare.
[[Design/overview]]
- Chuffed needs a text, audio, or video log for all meetings to update people retroactively.

- Chuffed needs all internal meetings to be voluntary.

- Chuffed wants all meetings to end with action points. If it doesn't, then it shouldn't have been a meeting.

## Process

Chuffed is an asynchronous company. That means to be documentation first with non-instantaneous communication. 

The only forms of synchronous works are:

- **Discussion** To delve deeper or explore pivoting a piece of work.

- **Brainstorming** To bring unrestrained ideas to the table.

- **Critique** To integrate an initiative.

It is the job of the creator of a meeting to pitch attendance to sync up. As mentioned, no meeting is mandatory.

## Agenda

It is the requirement of the creators of a meeting to form the agenda, and it is the onus of the attendees to digest beforehand. Therefore, this means items such as updates and explanations do not happen in the meeting. Instead, updates are created in text, audio, or video and consumed beforehand and then comments, questions, and feedback occur in the meeting.

The basic structure of an agenda is as follows:

**Purpose**

_Why does this meeting need to take place?_

**Takeaways**

_What should attendees expect to take away from the meeting?_

**Discusion Items**

_As a bullet point list, what will be discussed?_

**Action Points**

_Start with it empty at the start of the meeting and fill it as it progresses with the person and the task_
