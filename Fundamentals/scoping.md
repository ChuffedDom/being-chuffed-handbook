# Scoping

The aim of writing a clear and faultless scope is to communicate ideas, concepts and implementations

Chuffed envisages every product, feature, iteration, and fix to have a scope at a level that anyone can read and understand the work to be carried out and why.

- Chuffed endeavours to describe all aspects of work to be done transparently so that any stakeholder from any department can understand the intent and delivery.
- Chuffed will scope in a way that explains the tasks that Engineering must create to build a product, the marketing materials needed, and internal/external documentation.
- Chuffed looks to work in a document-first, asynchronous manner to enable all team members to work at any time, reduce the number of meetings, and be globally distributed. 

Start any scope with these basic statements.

**Purpose**

_Why should this work be carried out?_

**Vision**

_What does the completed work look like?_

**Goals**

_What will we have after the work that we don't have today?_

**Problem**

_What problem are we trying to solve, and who for?_

> ⬆️ Writing these first four statements to begin with is useful to get the conversation going.

**Hypothesis**

_What do we think a solution could look like?_

**Success**

_What does success look like?_

**Insights**

_How did we get here?_

**User Stories**

_What are the users' goals as they journey through the scoped work?_

**Acceptance Criteria**

_What is the state of doneness?_

**Concerns**

_What considerations should be taken into account?_

**Moving Forward**

_Where are we going next?_
