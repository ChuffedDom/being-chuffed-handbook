# User Interviews

The reason Chuffed seeks to be best in class in User Interviews, is that every piece of work and product is in vain of the pain points of the user's story.

Chuffed sees User Interview being the core of the company and generating a clear data store of people, and their, goals, motivations, and problems.

What needs to be achieved is:
- A clear, best in class, methodology in asking questions of people to determine what to build and how to deliver it.
- Delivering user-driven products, features, and iterations.
- Teams that Chuffed are involved with, either internally and externally, are not intuiting what needs to be built.

## ðŸš« Don't
- Talk about the product. 
- Put products / designs in front of people and ask if they like it.
## âœ… Do
- Ask questions that will help to find truthfulness in your Persona(s).
- Ask people how they feel whilst trying (and possibly failing) to accomplish they goals.
