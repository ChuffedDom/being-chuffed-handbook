# Persona

As we build a product that successfully solves a user's problem, we need to know who our user is. One way to summarise all potential and current users is to create a Persona. 

This method is a way to define the main characteristics that the team can empathise with and build for. As qualitative and quantitive data comes in, the Personas can be assessed for truthfulness, making it a source of truth for all other work.

What needs to be achieved is to:
- Focus the conversation around people and problems rather than features and UI.
- Be able to link back all user experience to user representation.
- To create a strategically insightful list of questions for user interviews by endeavouring to find truthfulness in the Persona.

There is no one way of persona writing but rather what fits the situation. Although, a Product early in its journey can have a basic form to get you started. You can add the following:

- A name
- A photo
- A quote
- A list of 3-5 motivations
- A list of 3-5 needs and wants
- A list of 1-3 pain points
- A list of 3-5 activities (what they are doing in the real world and online)

To start the process, create a speculative Persona that will help generate user interviews and survey questions. When speculating, the aim is to find the truthfulness in the lists above. For example, you may ask about being time-poor as that is one of the motivations, but discover that a lack of spare time is not the issue but rather a lack of will.
